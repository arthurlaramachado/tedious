# Tedious

**Tedious** is an interactive terminal task manager written in **Go** using the [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework.

The project allows you to create, navigate, and toggle tasks directly in the terminal, supporting multiple states:

- **Unmarked** – task not started  
- **InProgress** – task in progress  
- **Completed** – task finished  

The interface is minimalistic, focused on productivity in the terminal, automatically adding new tasks when navigating to the last line and allowing simple state toggling for each task.

Tedious aims to provide a fast and efficient way to manage tasks without leaving the terminal, keeping everything organized in an intuitive way, while keeping track of the time taken to complete each one of your tasks.
